## Universal Dependencies - Morphosyntactically Tagged Corpora

This is the Git repository collection for the [UDMorph](https://quest.ms.mff.cuni.cz/teitok-new/teitok/udmorph) project. UDMorph attempts to collect morphologically annotated corpora and taggers, following the guidelines of the [Universal Dependencies](https://universaldependencies.org/), for as many languages as possible.
